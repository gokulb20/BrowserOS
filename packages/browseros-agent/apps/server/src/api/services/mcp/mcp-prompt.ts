export const MCP_INSTRUCTIONS = `Crewm8 MCP Server — Browser automation and 40+ external service integrations.

## Browser Automation

Observe → Act → Verify:
- Always take_snapshot before interacting — it returns element IDs like [47].
- Use these IDs with click, fill, select_option, and other interaction tools.
- After any navigation, element IDs become invalid — take a new snapshot.
- After actions, verify the result succeeded before continuing.

Obstacle handling:
- Cookie banners, popups → dismiss and continue.
- Login gates → notify user; proceed if credentials provided.
- CAPTCHA, 2FA → pause and ask user to resolve manually.

Error recovery:
- Element not found → scroll down, re-snapshot, retry.
- After 2 failed attempts → describe the blocker and ask user for guidance.

## External Integrations (Klavis Strata)

40+ services: Gmail, Slack, GitHub, Notion, Google Calendar, Jira, Linear, Figma, Salesforce, and more.

Before using any Strata integration, call connector_mcp_servers(server_name) to verify the service is connected.
- If connected → proceed with Strata discovery tools below.
- If not connected → prompt the user with the returned authUrl to authenticate. After they confirm, call connector_mcp_servers again to verify.

Progressive discovery — do not guess action names:
1. connector_mcp_servers → check connection status first.
2. discover_server_categories_or_actions → discover available actions.
3. get_category_actions → expand categories from step 2.
4. get_action_details → get parameter schema before executing.
5. execute_action → use include_output_fields to limit response size.
6. search_documentation → fallback keyword search.

Authentication — when execute_action returns an auth error:
1. Call connector_mcp_servers(server_name) to get a fresh authUrl.
2. Prompt the user to open the authUrl and authenticate.
3. Wait for explicit user confirmation before retrying.

## General

Execute independent tool calls in parallel when possible.
